# Small-Town-Software-Project

## Overview
This software application is survey-based to collect data from the general community during town hall meetings. The survey asks questions that inquire about the demographic of a town and their concerns about walking sidewalks and bike routes. This tool is being developed for the [Carl Small Town Center](https://carlsmalltowncenter.org/) at Mississippi State University's Architecture Department.
